Welcome to my BlackCmd.This is my first tools when i was from 15 to 17 years old.So if you care for my tools,you can install and try using it.And during use,if you have any problems,you can leave a comment so i can review and fix errors,as well as build it towards the future.

Pay Attention: Because I am currently fixing many errors, it is expected to take a long time before I return. Therefore, all download links here have been revoked. When I return, this text will be removed, and the links will reappear. So, you don't need to check for updates now, as it is expected to be around next October.
